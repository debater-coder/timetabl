# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This website is still in development, and you should use it at your own risk. Despite this, I have taken all reasonable precautions to keep this app secure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in this project, you should send me a private email at hamzah.ahmed@student.sbhs.nsw.edu.au. As this is still in development I may not be able to respond to it immediately, but I will try to address it as soon as possible.
